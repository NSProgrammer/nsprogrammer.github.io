## The Blog

NSProgrammer blog is a place for me to drop some posts as the mood strikes.
It has no goals other than to capture thoughts for posterity and reference.

## The Dev

My name is Nolan O'Brien, and I'm a Canadian software developer living in Las Vegas with my wife and 5 kids.
I like hockey 🏒, whisky 🥃, 80s movies 🍿 and 80s vinyl records 🎵.
I have been developing software professionally for Apple platforms since 2004 with a bunch of time spent on
embedded systems, Win32 and Linux/Unix.
